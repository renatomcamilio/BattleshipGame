# BattleshipGame
Battleship Game as a midterm project @ Lighthouse Labs

##What?
Battleship Game for iPhone!

##Why?
Me and Mike had the idea to create something fun and challenging to deliver as a midterm project, so, why not?!

##How?
Basically, you'll need 2 players in order to play battleship. We plan to implement a v1.0 with One Player support (P vs CPU),
that means the player will create its fleet, and the CPU will have one randomly generated. Later on, we plan to support 2
(or more) players, backed by Parse(v2.0).
